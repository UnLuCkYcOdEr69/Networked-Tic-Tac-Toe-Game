This repository implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a server-client architecture, allowing two players to connect and compete over a network.

**Multiplayer**: Two clients can connect to a central server and engage in a head-to-head Tic-Tac-Toe match.
**Server-Based Game Management**: The server handles game logic, including turn management, board state updates, and win/draw detection, ensuring a smooth and fair experience.
**Client-Side User Interface**: Each client displays the game board and facilitates player interaction (selecting moves).

**Usage**:
1. At first start the server
2.Then open two client side as two players are required to play the game
